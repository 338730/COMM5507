seen story somewhere read books similar plots really remember point crap series pretends deliver kind message greed people need things normally would never simply deliver least seen somewhere idea phenomonal create fun every social material satisfation within normal human societies offer opportunity nothing nothing within normal human societies inspiring extreme setting careful cannot represent whole society whats great series doesnt rely sensationalist disturbing factors alone theres decent plot well arranged elements unravelling story theme playing life isnt necessarily unique formula incredibly well done adapting story south korea based childhood games telling fable social economic struggles life worth living thought main actors great dont get see enough characters hope opens exposure international productionsthe production settings also really impressive made scenes fascinatingi hope netflix pays creator bonus deserves given success scenario okeyactings okey offcourse big budget netflix serie deserves max 7 point watches real good tv series fans okey nothing special worst part mostly watch netflix production see production series orijinal somethingagain exaggerated one serie like la casa della papel understand success see netflix knows catch series especially remarkable visual production personal level enjoy saw complete entertaining seems way enjoy would ignore multiple script holes inconsistencies plot appreciate technicalvisual section interesting concept dont get many adult characters corean showsmovies ive seen act like onedimensional overdramatic
