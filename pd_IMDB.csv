","Well multiple games actually, but even that you may find ... not accurate. Now you may not look the same way at some games that are being played here. But with all the buzz right now, you've probably heard quite a bit about that already.If like you got into this without any spoilers (congrats by the way), then the show will be able to surprise quite a few times. Be it by the players themselves but also and even more so by how the story evolves. It may not end exactly how I would imagine ... but that can also be seen as a good thing I reckon.As a fan of Korean cinema I was curious about this anyway. And it did not dissapoint - at all. The acting is amazing, the effects are great ... and the story is as mature as it can get. With enough social commentary and critique to make this a great watch!",9

",Exciting show that keeps you watching. The Korean part is the emotional connection with the characters and their financial problems and how they have family obligations. The violence although comically exaggerated is unusual for a K drama. Good acting from LSJ and PHS veteran actors. Striking set design gives it a visually glossy look.

","Greetings from Lithuania.I liked and enjoyed ""Squid Game"" (2021) series for its interesting and simple concept which at the end of the day was very solidly executed. Acting was very solid, as well as directing and writing. The whole concept felt fresh and kinda original and it was easy to get attached and watch the whole show. Ending was also pretty interesting, although a bit predictable.Overall, i enjoyed ""Squid Game"". It felt fresh and was involving as well being believable throughout. I believe that given its popularity it will get more seasons. As long as they will be solid as the first one, I'm in for this show.",7
10,851222," Good concept and solid excecution
","The production behind this show is representative of The Dangerous Game and Hunger Games. Satanic baddies that run the world are desperate to feel any kind of emotion, which apparently comes from dehumanizing the masses and defiling the innocent.Those that find fulfillment are already found to degeneracy. You are subconsciously being conditioned to accept this as the new normal. Pay attention. If you can afford it.Is it a joke if they are telling you what they are doing?",8
11,John6Daniels," 10th time. All Father give me strength.
","Korean Drama ""Squid Game"" is bloody, but, somehow, hopeful.It has a nice cinematography, with, sometimes, overused gore, but well executed action scenes. The background stories, moreover, set the drama apart from the rest of the survival game series, and it gives a more 'Korean Drama' feel to it. It makes the story more believable, as it helps the viewer relate to the characters and understand them. It also gave a more humane twist to the story and made it more dramatic, when the settings and the costumes were more on the childish side.Finally, the performances were great by everyone in the cast.So, overall, 7 out of 10.",1

","Creator and director Dong-hyuk Hwang certainly had one crazy vision, and successfully made a series of it. Sure it has plot and technical issues, and I wasn't fond of the ending - I re-wrote it in my head much better, but for a somewhat newb Korean filmmaker, this was epic.The visuals, props and sets were outstanding. The cinematography and score amazing. The casting and performances by all, except the VIP's, was excellent. Props to Neflix once again, and thanks for dubbing this one right this time.

","A great concept here as desperate people with financial problems compete for a huge sum of money(apparently $38 mil American). They must play games against one another with a severe penalty for losing. Like the Sopranos, with some of the episodes better than others. Number six was the best for me. The sets are Wes Anderson like, with bright colors filling the screen. The lead actors are excellent and the scripts very well written. The violence is over the top with no comic relief in sight. The final episode was a bit of a letdown but overall I was highly entertained.",8

","09/23/2021 The first few episodes were fun to watch as they played out but as the series progressed, a more serious, ominous storyline starts to unfold due to viewers empatheticly connecting with a few of the characters facing uncertainty as the game continues, even possible death? I found the series in the overall really great, refreshingly new and well planned out as it unfolded. I hope that somehow the series will continue on into the future with many more seasons to come? A great show from my perspective!",9
18,alindsay-al," A Fantastic truly unique show
","This is an entertaining series from South Korea that embodies elements of Korean Soap Opera, Chinese Operatic acting and Japanese theater. It uses classical Chinese opera techniques such as the wide open eyes to portray fear and anger....and a lot of shouting.It uses ""Hunger Games"" as it's base and survival of the fittest as its main theme. The story is well crafted but unfortunately starts to lose its grip on reality by about episode 4. It then slides into a lot of moralizing and philosophical conversations that culminates in the final episode. It is set up for a second season (if one can judge from the final episode) but runs the risk of becoming very formula driven Have to agree with the other comments about the group of ""actors"" playing the VIPs. They obviously came cheap and might not even have been actors at all! Enjoyable for what it's meant to be!",8

","So.... the ENTIRE premise is based on 'let's play games that we played as kids, that were based on skill and that are completely fair, and we're ALL on equal ground'.... series keeps that premise from EP01 until EP05, where it becomes not only a rigged game, but also no longer based on skill, but COMPLETELY based on luck. This is a GIANT problem because the entire premise of ""we play fair games against each other, based on skill"" is throw out the window. Honestly, the series is pretty great before that, but after that, the series is a poor 5/10. If they didn't completely throw out the premise that the series was based on, half way down the line, then this would have been a 9/10 series. I think they should make a Season2, and I just hope to God that in Season2, they don't completely derail the premise like they did in Season1, because Season1 is completely spoiled because of that.",7

The same money that come from the blood and sweat of others.The capitalist system claims that there is equity And justice in the distribution of the wealth.

It does makes many apt comments about contemporary society - Ali's story is particularly sad as is Sae- Byeok's and the way we treat people just seeking a better life.

The viewer doesn't want to see this guy anymore...After this, nearly all interactions are based on the villain being the hero, and the previous main story guy is treated like a lucky whimp, even though he is decisive and moral.

It makes insightful social commentary about subjects such as extreme financial disparities. It addresses depression and post-traumatic stress disorder.

The poor were just things for him to play with, for some fun and excitement. Anyway, the range of emotions I felt while watching the episodes was enough to leave me somewhat exhausted, but in a good way. Really, I gotta hand it to the team that worked on this because it was clearly a high budget and high quality production.

There is plenty of action, suspense, and that occasional gore, but all of those exciting scenes are just a backdrop to the heart-wrenching storyline filled with irony, philosophy, and a message with a punch. ""Squid Game"" is a cinematic experience that stays with you, similar to movies like ""Pulp Fiction,"" and I am glad that it has inched up to the number one spot in Netflix, instead of being lost in the enormous library of mediocre shows that uninspired people watch just to waste time.

I dunno why but Japanese directors are more capable of creating stunning gore effects and death/necro scenes. Which is to say, If u can't stand the horror and jump-scare of Alice in the Borderland, then Squid Game is the one more u. It is visually mild in every aspects, plus a warmer story to make u feel easier.Back to Squid Game, I think it's not something original and groundbreaking.

And happily, we don't see another unnecessary and intrusive homo love story.The scenes are captive, great colors and screen format, all the details are perfectly touched, the music nicely fits the acts.

Don't watch this for the premise watch it for the relationships.,6

The show gets better as the episodes go on and I found myself rooting for a few of the participants. It's a fun show to watch, but the cruelty of humankind is just insane. The lengths people will go to survive is real and sad. I watched with subtitles because dubbing is always terrible and takes away from the characters in my opinion.

","Squid game is what I can only describe as an evolution of the Battle Royale genre, what I mean by that is that you have a premise of putting x people into a deathmatch situation where only the best or luckiest individuals can get out alive. This heavily reminds me of Gyakkyou Burai Kaiji: Ultimate Survivor (Anime) and another movie called As the gods will, but this series did something quite unique and unthinkable which deconstructs many tropes and cliches.Honestly this is very well made, You get to feel for everyone's struggles and motivations to the point where it becomes relatable.I highly recommend you to give it a watch!",7

This is not, as many critics have claimed, a gory show. It's no more violent than something like Game of Thrones. Less so, as the main violence is people being dispatched by gunfire.

","I think if I spoke Korean and could watch this without it being dubbed, I would probably love it and give it at least 9 starts. But the dubbing is bad and the dialogue is amateurish. I'm guessing they have to make the English words fit the time frame of the actor's mouths moving and maybe because of that it is not a direct translation and that is why it is often so bad. But beyond that, the voice actors doing the dubbing are often pretty flat in their delivery.

Also, the show has a lot of side stories, so if one was expecting to see a simple kill and run show, then they will probably find this show boring. Lastly, the show is full of korean cultural references which can also be a boring factor for many viewers. It's simply because people can't understand what's going on and have more questions rather than enjoying the thrills of the ride. Overall, the show is entertaining and enjoyable. It still drew me to the 5th episode straight. But again It would have been nicer if it had more actions unless the show was originally intended as a social commentary.

I couldn't help wondering whether millions of viewers all over the world also have the same question: if you are up to your neck in debt, would you join the game?I guess the reason I kept watching this despite my aversion to violence is because the violence is necessary to show viewers the horrendousness of greed.

As for the latter, EVERY character is struggling to make ends meet but how they put themselves in that position is extremely unique. The group is diverse with the main guy having to pay a debt he owes to land sharks, his friend having embezzled money from his business, an old man who is living out his remaining time with a brain tumor, a gangster who stole money from his boss, a woman who got scammed and more.

","If you're looking for the stereotypical K-Drama with romance, no cussing, nudity, sex, or gore, DO NOT watch this. Netflix has absolutely smashed the Korean television stereotype out of the park - in a good way. The twists and shock that this series has is mind-bending. It will have your jaw on the floor after each episode. I'd say my only gripe is the open ending.

There's a good story line to follow but I found it a bit excessive when it came to blood but being a horror fan, I was able to deal with this part of the series. On the whole, the series is a study in human behavior especially under critical conditions and I'm sure this show will be a required study in all psychology classes. IMO, I feel as though the writers were paying homage to Stanley Kubrick and his portfolio of work. See if you can see the similarities as you get deeper into the story line. There are 9 episodes which last about an hour and one that's about 30 minutes long. There's been much talk about it on social media and that's given it a boost in viewership but all in all it kept my attention enough to see how it was going to end.

It discloses the motivation of the characters, which is, eventually, irrelevant. It allows to fill half of a season instead of filming 1.5 hour movies.Do I think it's a bad show?

The plot is quite predictable, the actors make stupid faces and a lot of unnecessary noise and movements. It just got plain silly and boring. Seen this story somewhere, or read some books with similar plots, I do not really remember.

There are many other films with the theme of survival games, but what distinguishes squid games from others is that it departs from the issue of social reality in society. Squid game provides a heart-wrenching reality that humans who are in huge debt are willing to do anything, including selling their lives for a deadly game. As for the conglomerate people who are tired of having got everything they want in life, they see the hardships of the poor as entertainment. In the end, the winner of this game realizes that winning money by killing others is not something fun, so the 456 billion is meaningless. This is what I think makes the Squid game very popular.",4

Also, I skipped the entire first 40 minutes of the first episode and lost none of the story. That tells me it was just a time filler. My only other real issue is the captions, which are pretty awful.

Then some episodes do very little character development, there is very little drama, there is very little addition to the whole series.Another thing that I think could've been improved (and maybe should be - if there is to be a second season) is that a lot of times there are enough clues in an episode where you can guess the exactly what is going on.

The ""baddie"" just does stereotypical baddie.Central story is fine. Interesting at times. Sets are very good. Didn't like the ending. Don't why the writer thought that would be a better ending than just the winner's game comes to an end and then he witnesses the beginning of the next one.An alright show in my opinion but don't understand the hype.",10

Awful acting (can barely read their lines right), and some cringy dialogue from those characters. They also tried to make them comedic, which was totally out of the blue and weird. They reuse the same song over and over for most of the series. And for the love of god, stop making Korean actors speak English. It's extremely hard to act in your second language, and you can tell some of the actors have never said a word in English. It really takes you out of the immersion.

Especially the first game, ""red light, green light"", terrified the audience beautifully and reflected the traumaticity and drama, which is the theme of the series.

","This is a series from South Korea in mainly the Korean language
I am 99% sure the reason why the VIPs are talking the way they are is because of this
They are not acting bad, the acting is fine! What feels amiss to us is that they talk slowly and pronounce very clearly, and this is deliberate. They speak slowly and clearly because this show was intended for a Korean audience and not an US or even English speaking audience
and this is why it feels kinda off to those people
We are used to Netflix shows in US or British English where people speak perfect everyday English (whatever that means) and here they tried to ensure a non English speaker or someone with limited English skills can follow the VIP conversations
This is my theory I said what I said

I wish the creators of the series would depicted the violence a little less graphic and disturbing. Maybe leaving the consequences of losing a gaming to the viewers' imagination. Violence and bloodletting aside, the series was good in a dark way. I can't say that I ""enjoyed"" the series, it was, however, interesting and a bit fascinating.

The mental and emotional damage shown by the players towards throughout felt so genuine. You found yourself cheering for the characters, only to be hit by the gravity of what is to happen after. They say money doesn't buy happiness, I disagree to an extent. Money would solve all of my depression right now. I have a happy marriage with a lovely wife, a beautiful son, and a decent house. However, we are so in debt due to NICU bills and other debts, and are about to lose our home. I have been thrown so low to the point of some of these characters, and I could relate to them.

And having heard Squid Game being heaped together with Battle Royals I couldn't care less about, I begun watching with low expectations. And what a horribly pleasant surprise it was! You'll get character depth and story structures you wouldn't expect from the genre. Maybe it won't live up to the hype for Battle Royal aficionados, but for the casually curious ones, you need not to worry that this will be a waste of your time. I gave 10 out of 10 as Squid Game expands the survival horror genre in general, and obviously raises the bar for the sub genre of Battle Royals.",5

","Great story, great pacing and visually, it packs a punch! It is similar to Battle Royale however, it delves deeper and provides great character development and a real feast for the eyes in terms of the colourful sets and and costumes. It's raises many questions around humanity and how far you would go to help others or save yourself.It's a wild ride from the moment it begins and the relatable characters really draw you in. There have been a lot of comments about the VIPs - just ignore those! The version of the film I watched is dubbed so maybe there's a reason for the slightly off-pace intonations; but that doesn't take away from the performances.It's certainly binge worthy and if you can handle the odd violent scene, then go for it!",10

Not just that but those who have never seen anime because of stigma but would enjoy the medium LOVE this show because it's the first thing they have seen like it. Everyone is raving about this show because they have never seen anything like it (except for us anime watchers). I believe this show's popularity represents a huge shift in entertainment.

The acting is superb, the production profesh, the design amazing, but ultimately nothing new, nothing original and the overall strength is in the details.

","This is just a masterpiece from the beginning. The sets are all real, which brings just a greater sense of awe to the spectacle that is Squid Game. The actors are picked perfectly, and all play a major part into making this the marvel it is. The story ramps up almost scene by scene, bringing true emotions to my face while watching it. Sadness, happiness, anger, and at times disgust are major emotional aspects within the first season. The ending was amazing, but also brought a ton of emotion out of me due to the connection I felt that I gained during watching this. I have one reserved worry to this series, and that is the execution of the next season. At times, series can burn out or run out of that initial spark that drove the show to stardom. An example of a popular show that felt to lose this spark would be Riverdale. I hope this is not the case for Squid Game, and I will be rooting for it to continue its great success.",1

","Squid Game Ojing-eo Geimis a South Korean survival drama television series on Netflix created by Hwang Dong-hyuk, who wrote and directed all nine episodes. Its cast includes Lee Jung-jae, Park Hae-soo, Wi Ha-joon, Jung Ho-yeon, O Yeong-su, Heo Sung-tae, Anupam Tripathi, and Kim Joo-ryoung. The series revolves around a contest where 456 players in deep financial debt put their lives at risk to play a series of children's games for the chance to win a 45.6 billion a prize. The title of the series draws from a similarly named Korean children's game. Hwang had conceived of the idea based on his own economic struggles early in life as well as the class disparity in South Korea. Though he had initially written it in 2009, he was unable to find a production company to fund the idea until Netflix took an interest around 2019 as part of their drive to expand their foreign programming offerings.",7

It has lots of very unique violent scenes that at times I found myself stunned for a moment but loving every second of how this show pulls you in. You can really feel for so many of the characters and I found myself really rooting for my favorites but knowing in the back of my head that they will all probably die in this crazy life or death game one after another until it reaches the winner. Episode 6 Gganbu is so mind blowing and heartbreaking. I'm sincerely hoping we get a season 2. We need more squid games minus the ridiculous VIP's or at least get them to speak like an actual human being would. Geez! That is the only reason I didn't give this rating a 9.,8

The dubbing just made this so much worse. Example (police officer: ""red light green light, you mean that game meant for kids?"") TERRIBLY CHEESY writing right there and horrible voice acting.

That game was the 1st game those players in this tv show played (i dont remember its name in a foreign language), the one they needed to freeze after the count stop... So i was realy amazed by finding this great tv show. Its seriously shown how our mind worked as kids and how we been more active as kids- as shown Through all the games in this amazing tv show. So yes its a big 10/10 for me.Recommended to any human being on this earth.",8

This time around is the first time I've ""LOVED"" a series and hooked it from start to finish. The story is original and it feels like a kind of hunger game, with characters who are in dire straits and who fight until the end to win a huge amount of money. The fact that the series is really different from all the other series is that it has its own universe, its own setting. Watching this series is like a drug. We are addicted and we want more, we want to know more things. We easily get attached to the characters because we pity them enough. And I think it's a good lesson in morale, this series certainly represents, a little exaggerated, today's society. I can only advise you.

Worryingly, I feel the complexity of the message may mean it is lost on the average viewer, but left me deep in though and reflection upon its completion.I'm sure in the years to come this series will be looked back on as the benchmark for complex and contrasted story telling, and even though it is extremely popular now, in years to come it's message may be more appreciated.",10

If you're in it for the survival horror of it all, this might be an entertaining thrill ride, and that's okay.
